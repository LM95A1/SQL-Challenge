# SQL Challenge
*SQL Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 9*

This repository contains the following:

* SQL files in the *Schema Drafts* directory that led to the creation of the final schema in the *EmployeeSQL* directory
* Screenshots of the results from the analysis portion in the *Analysis Screenshots* directory
* The image of the ERD as requested, contained in the *Analysis Screenshots* directory

---

The *Schema Drafts* directory includes a SQL file named *CSV Import Schema* that was scrapped at the final phase of the assignment. This file was used to import the CSV files into the database from the *Sources* directory, but the final schema's Data Analysis portion was completed after manually importing the CSVs using PostgreSQL's import tool. The *CSV Import Schema* file is included for reference.

*PostgreSQL 14* was used for this assignment, tested on two different machines. The *EmployeeSQL* directory contains the final schema, aptly named *Final Schema*.

All SQL files were drafted and completed in *Visual Studio Code*, assisted by *Stack Overflow* and the *PostgreSQL* documentation since I have currently have the brain capacity of a corpse.

Coding Soundtrack for this week's challenge was STARSET's album, [Vessels 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb2Iq1Q3jZ6ZtCRGqgzYjLAzy4j6snBUh).
